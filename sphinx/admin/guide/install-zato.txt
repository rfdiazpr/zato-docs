Installing Zato binaries
========================

Overview
--------

The same binaries need to be installed in each operation system that any Zato component
- such as servers - will be running on.

The current version of |version| has been tested on the following systems:

* `Ubuntu Linux 12.04 LTS <http://www.ubuntu.com/>`_
* `Linux Mint 13 LTS <http://www.linuxmint.com/index.php>`_
* `Fedora 18 <https://fedoraproject.org/>`_
* `OS X <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X>`_

CentOS/RHEL users - please visit 
`ticket #68 <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/issues/68>`_
on GitHub. Zato 1.2 will add an installer for your systems.

There is nothing Linux or OS X-specific to Zato's codebase and future Zato versions 
will certainly add installers for additional platforms and systems.

Please :doc:`let the project know <../../project/get-involved>`
what operating system you're using Zato on or where you'd like to see it run.

Note that if you'd like to install Zato on other systems you need to make sure
they have Python 2.7.x. None other version can be used, only the latest Python
version in the 2.7 series is supported.

Steps
-----

* Prepare a system with at least 300 MB of disk space 
* Ensure you have root/sudo permissions on that system
* Make sure the system will let the installer establish outgoing connections to the Internet,
  this is needed in order to download all the dependencies required

* Install
  `rsync <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync>`_
  and
  `curl <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL>`_

* (OS X only) Install `homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_
  
* Download 
  `the installation package <https://zato.io/download/zato-1.1.tar.bz2>`_, e.g.:

  .. parsed-literal::
      
    $ curl -O https://zato.io/download/zato-1.1.tar.bz2
  
* Decompress the package and enter the newly created directory, e.g.:

  .. parsed-literal::
  
    $ tar -xjf zato-|version|.tar.bz2 && cd zato-|version|
    
* Install :doc:`latest hotfixes <./hotfixes>`

  .. parsed-literal::
  
    zato-1.1$ curl -O https://zato.io/hotfixes/hotfixman.sh && bash hotfixman.sh
    
* Run the installer 

  .. parsed-literal::
  
    zato-1.1$ ./install.sh

  There will be a lot of output written out to stdout and on a successful completion
  you will see OK printed out, e.g.
  
  .. parsed-literal::
  
    zato-1.1$ ./install.sh 
    [sudo] password for user: 
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree
    
    ..
    .. (snipped output)
    ..
    
    patch: in zato-1.1/code/eggs/ ..
    patch: processing 1/1:	 zato-1.1/code/eggs/ ..
    patch: successfully patched zato-1.1/code/eggs/ ..

    OK
    zato-1.1$

  Depending on how fast the system is and on the quality of the
  Internet connectivity, it will take at least several minutes for the installer
  to complete so in that time, why don't you have a look at 
  :doc:`the tutorial <../../tutorial/01>`,
  :doc:`Zato's <../../intro/overview-high-level>`
  :doc:`overview <../../intro/overview-tech>`, 
  :doc:`its architecture <../../architecture/overview>`,
  :doc:`the web-admin <../../web-admin/intro>`, 
  :doc:`programming documentation<../../progguide/overview>`
  and
  :doc:`several  <../../admin/cli/index>`
  :doc:`of  <../../admin/guide/install-config/overview>`
  :doc:`the  <../../admin/guide/ha>`
  :doc:`admin  <../../admin/guide/capacity>`
  :doc:`guides <../../admin/guide/installing-services>`
  or something else in 
  :doc:`the docs <../../index>`?

  
* Add zato-1.1/bin to $PATH so that the zato command is available in the shell, e.g.


  .. parsed-literal::
  
    zato-1.1$ echo export 'PATH=$PATH:'$(pwd)/bin >> ~/.bashrc
    zato-1.1$ source ~/.bashrc

  * Linux:

    .. parsed-literal::
    
      zato-1.1$ echo export 'PATH=$PATH:'$(pwd)/bin >> ~/.bashrc
      zato-1.1$ source ~/.bashrc
      
  * OS X:

    .. parsed-literal::
    
      zato-1.1$ echo export 'PATH=$PATH:'$(pwd)/bin >> ~/.profile
      zato-1.1$ source ~/.profile

    
* Confirm the zato command can be executed

  .. parsed-literal::
  
    zato-1.1$ zato --version
    Zato |version|
    zato-1.1$
  
* That's all, Zato has been successfully installed in the system. 
  You can now visit :doc:`the main documentation index <../../index>` and have 
  fun with the next generation ESB and application server!
