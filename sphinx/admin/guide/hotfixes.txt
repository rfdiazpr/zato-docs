Installing hotfixes
===================

Overview
--------

Hotfixes are a means used to distribute fixes to confirmed and
important issues without a need for users to install a new Zato version. No new
user-visible features are delivered in that way, only code changes that truly fix
a significant situtation are installed.

Hotfixes always need to be installed on each operating system Zato binaries have
been installed in.

After installing hotfixes, you need to use
:doc:`zato stop <../cli/stop>`
and
:doc:`zato start <../cli/start>`
to restart each Zato component running so the hotfixes are picked up.

INSTALL_DIR is a directory where Zato binaries are kept in, e.g. if full path to
zato is /opt/zato-install/bin/zato then INSTALL_DIR is /opt/zato-install.

Files are always backed up and stored in INSTALL_DIR/hotfixes/backups-YOUR_ZATO_VERSION before they're
updated however no files are backed up if a hotfix has been already applied.

Running hotfixman.sh, as below, will always connect to the hotfix repository,
download the latest bundle of hotfixes and install them all. There is no support
for installing only a partial list of fixes.

Steps
-----

* Ensure you have curl and rsync installed on each system you will install hotfixes
  on

* Go to INSTALL_DIR
  
* Download 
  `the hotfix installer <https://zato.io/hotfixes/hotfixman.sh>`_
  and make it executable, e.g.:

  .. parsed-literal::
      
    INSTALL_DIR$ curl -O https://zato.io/hotfixes/hotfixman.sh
    INSTALL_DIR$ chmod u+x ./hotfixman.sh
    
  (Note: Zato 1.2 will ship with hotfixman.sh out of the box)
  
* Run the hotfix installer 

  .. parsed-literal::
      
    INSTALL_DIR$ ./hotfixman.sh
    
* Make sure the output doesn't mention any warnings or errors, if it does,
  open a ticket on `GitHub <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/issues>`_.
  
  A normal output will be similar to the one below, i.e. only informational
  messages have been written out:
