Managing server objects en masse
================================

Overview
--------

In addition to the
:doc:`GUI <../../web-admin/intro>`,
:doc:`CLI <../cli/index>`
and
:doc:`API <../../public-api/intro>`,
you can use the `enmasse <https://zato.io/download/enmasse>`_ command line tool
to manage :doc:`ODB-based <../../architecture/sql-odb>` server objects as a group.
This lets you store each piece of configuration
as a set of JSON files in a repository where they will be versioned or backed up
and to use enmasse to perform roll-outs from command line without the use of GUI
or other methods.

Enmasse does not deal with services, it's concerned with server objects only
which is anything but services, including channels, scheduler jobs or security
definitions and other types. How to deploy services is documented in 
:doc:`a separate chapter <./installing-services>`.

Enmasse will never delete existing objects. This needs to be performed using the GUI or API.

Tasks you can use enmasse for
-----------------------------

* Exporting server objects from a cluster into JSON
* Preparing cluster configuration in JSON and merging it with a contents
  of an already existing cluster
* Importing objects from an export file into clusters, optionally replacing objects that already exist

Usage scenarios
---------------

* You create a development cluster and quickly prototype a solution using the
  :doc:`GUI <../../web-admin/intro>`. For tests and production, however, you prefer
  to store the config in a git repository. Hence you use enmasse to export all server
  objects from a dev cluster into JSON. The JSON is next imported to tests and later on,
  on production.
  
* You have an already existing cluster and want to add or replace server objects.
  You prepare a JSON config file and import it to a cluster.
  
* You have a team of programmers each responsible for a part of a solution and you
  want to limit the number of conflicts in a central config repository. You split
  the local JSON config file into multiple smaller ones each of which can be included
  by enmasse to form a whole that will be imported as a single unit.

Installing 
----------

* Make sure INSTALL_DIR/bin is on $PATH, where INSTALL_DIR is a directory you 
  :doc:`installed <./install-zato>` Zato binaries to. This is where the 'py' command
  needed by enmasse resides (note that it's 'py', not 'python').
  
* Download `enmasse <https://zato.io/download/enmasse>`_ and display its help to confirm the download was successful

  ::
  
      $ curl -O https://zato.io/download/enmasse
      $ py enmasse --help
      usage: enmasse [-h] [--store-log] [--verbose] [--store-config]
                     [--export-local] [--export-odb] [--import]
                     [--ignore-missing-defs] [--replace-odb-objects] [--input INPUT]
                     [--cols_width COLS_WIDTH] [--path PATH]
      
      Manages server objects en masse.
      
      optional arguments:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        --store-log           Whether to store an execution log
        --verbose             Show verbose output
        --store-config        Whether to store config options in a file for a later
                              use
        --export-local        Export local JSON definitions into one file (can be
                              used with --export-odb)
        --export-odb          Export ODB definitions into one file (can be used with
                              --export-local)
        --import              Import definitions from a local JSON (excludes
                              --export-*)
        --ignore-missing-defs
                              Ignore missing definitions when exporting to JSON
        --replace-odb-objects
                              Force replacing objects already existing in ODB during
                              import
        --input INPUT         Path to an input JSON document
        --cols_width COLS_WIDTH
                              A list of columns width to use for the table output,
                              default: 15,100
        --path PATH           Path to a running Zato server
      $ 


.. note ::

   Enmasse will become zato enmasse, part of CLI, in one of the future Zato releases.


Workflow
--------

* Either export objects from an already existing cluster to a JSON file or create
  the file from scratch, the format is given in later sections.
  
* Customize the JSON config file, optionally splitting it into smaller units
  that can be included later on.
  
* Combine all the includes, optionally merging ODB objects from a cluster of choice,
  into an export file. This is a file that can be imported to clusters. Note that
  its format is not documented and may change without prior notice.
  
* Import objects from an export file, optionally replacing objects that already
  exist in a cluster.
  
Notes
~~~~~

* Both --export-* arguments always need an input JSON file in --input, if you're
  just starting out, put an empty dictionary {} to the file, but remember that
  it must exist and must not be empty.
  
* --path is always required and serves a double role. 

  If you're exporting data it must be path to a running
  server you're exporting data from. Just point it to any existing server directory even if you're
  not exporting data from ODB. The requirement to point --path to a server even if
  ODB is not used will be lifted in future versions.
  
  If you're importing data --path must be path to a running server you're importing data into.
  
* For exports, --input means an input JSON file out of which an export file should be created.

  For imports, --input is an export file out of which definitions should be imported on a cluster.
  
* For imports, the order enmasse works in is guaranteed to be:

  * Existing definitions are updated
  * Existing objects other than definitions are updated
  * New definitions are created
  * New objects other than definitions are created
  
  This way, objects that depend on definitions can be sure the definitions
  they need already exist in the ODB.
  
* If channels or outgoing connections are active and they require connectors,
  the connectors will be started right away. This may mean a flurry of activity on a cluster's
  connector server. It may be worthwhile to consider whether such channels and outgoing
  connection should not be imported in an inactive state, enabling them manually later on.
  
* When creating an export file, enmasse tries to report as many warnings and errors
  in one go as possible. When importing a file, it does the contrary, and will stop as soon
  as it encounters anything it can't deal with to give you a chance to have a look
  at an erroneous situation as early as it can be done.

Dissecting a JSON config file
-----------------------------

.. note ::

  * Unlike when using the GUI or API, the security definition names you use in JSON
    must be unique in a cluster. That is, not only there cannot be, say, two HTTP Basic
    Auth definitions known as 'mysecurity-def' but it's an error to have a HTTP Basic Auth
    and a technical account or a WS-Security one under this name.
    
  * If a given HTTP object, such as a channel or an outgoing connection,
    should not use any security definition ('sec_def') at all, you should use a special
    constant string 'zato-no-security' to signal it. It cannot be None/null,
    it must be this exact string.
    
Configuration is kept in a JSON file that contains a dictionary of well-known
keys and a list of values for each key.

Keys are the types of server objects the config contains. Values are objects
themselves written either as dictionaries or as links to files containing 
the configuration of each object individually - one file is one object. If not
absolute, paths to files are relative to the main config file.

All the supported keys are discussed below. For values, they're almost always
equivalent to API calls used to manage them and only differences are documented.

You never use any IDs in JSON config files, only human-readable names and types are used.

Passwords are always given in clear-text.

When using definitions, they don't necessarily have to exist anywhere at the time 
the input JSON is created however a warning will be displayed if an object depends
on a definition which doesn't exist at that time - you can skip displaying this warning using
the --ignore-missing-defs switch when invoking enmasse. This may makes sense if you
know that such definitions will be available at the time the export file will be imported
into a cluster.
