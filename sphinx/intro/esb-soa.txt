===========================
What ESB and SOA are anyway
===========================

The ESB acronym expands to an Enterprise Service Bus. SOA stands for Service
Oriented Architecture. 

But if you're reading this chapter, there's a chance these definitions
don't tell you too much so here's more information in plain English, without
much corporate speak.

-----------------
A shorter version
-----------------

ESB is software, and SOA is an architectural approach, that let you:


* Save time
* Save money
* Spend Friday evenings with your friends and family instead of answering 
  calls from higher-ups demanding information why your system is down *again*

---------------
The whole truth
---------------

Think what happens when you log into your bank's frontend application:

1) Your name is displayed
2) The account balance is there
3) Your credit and debit cards are shown
4) A list of your mutual funds can be there
5) You get a pre-computed list of attractive loans you might be interested in

Now, it's very likely that all that pieces belong to different systems and applications,
each of which exposes data through a service of some sort (HTTP, JSON, XML, SOAP, FTP, CSV, 
doesn't really matter): 

1) is from a CRM running on Linux and Oracle
2) is from a COBOL system on z/OS mainframe
3) is said to be from a mainframe but they're too tightlipped to tell you anything, only that
   they prefer CSV over anything else
4) is from a mix of PHP and Ruby running on Windows
5) is from PostgreSQL, Python and Java running on Linux and Solaris

The question now is, how do you make the frontend app talk to 1-5? **Well, you don't.**

This is the fundamental basis of making sure such environments can scale above
a handful of systems. **You don't let them talk to each other directly**.

In the diagram below, each invocation of a service another system offers is
represented in a line of different width or style:

.. image:: /gfx/intro/mess1.png
   :alt:

Note that we didn't even show you any higher-level processes (App1 invokes App2
and either App3 or App5 depending on whether an earlier response from App 6
was successful so that App4 can at a later time grab data produced by App 2 but
only if App 1 doesn't forbit it etc.).

Also note that we're not talking about servers - each of the systems may run
on 10 physical servers so there are at least 60 components talking to each other.

Some questions become apparent.   
   
How can you plan rollouts? How do you coordinate updates or planned downtimes?
Each application is managed by different teams, vendors or departments and half
of the original developers have left already.

If you think you can handle 6 applications, how about 30 of them?

.. image:: /gfx/intro/mess2.png
   :alt:

Can you deal with 400? How about 2000? (We'll spare you a diagram)

There's a good name for that situation. It's called a mess.

------------------------------
How can you clean up the mess?
------------------------------

First thing is to honestly admit that the situation has gotten out of hand. This
allows one to look for a remedy without feeling too much guilt. OK, it happened,
you didn't know any better, but there's a chance it can be cleaned up.

This many mean an organizational change in an approach to IT but another step is 
to recall that systems and applications are not created merely
to push data around. They're meant to support business processes, regardless of what
your business is, banking, audio recordings, radiolocation devices, anything. 

Once you got that two clearly stated you can start thinking of building 
or redesigning your systems around services. 

A service is something interesting, reuable and atomic that is offered by one
system to another. This  is the shortest meaningful definition possible.

If a given functionality of a system fullfils these 3 requiremenents, that is, if it's:

* **I** nteresting

* **R** eusable

* **A** tomic

then there's a very good chance it could and should be exposed as a service to
other systems.

Let's discuss this IRA approach through a couple of examples

=================== =============================================================================================
Variable            Notes
=================== =============================================================================================
Environment         An electricity company's CRM
Functionality       Returning a list of customers that were active in a self-service portal in Q3 2012
Is it interesting?  Yes, quite interesting. This can be used to generated all sorts of useful reports
                    and statistics.
Is it reusable?     No, not really. Although it does allow for constructing higher-level constructs,
                    such as statistics for a whole year, it's clear that there won't be much interest for it
                    in 2018.
Is it atomic?       Most likely, yes. If there are similar services for other quarters, it will be possible
                    get an insight into the whole year 
How to make it IRA? * Make it accept arbitrary start and stop dates instead of being limited to one quarter only
                    * Make it accept arbitrary applications, not only the portal, let the application you're
                      interested in be an input parameter, it cannot be hard-coded to the portal only

Variable            Notes
=================== =============================================================================================
Environment         e-commerce site
Functionality       Returning each piece of information regarding a given customer ever collected
Is it interesting?  Well, yes. If you have access to the whole of it you'll be always able to choose what you
                    really need.
Is it reusable?     Funnily enough, not exactly. There will be very few applications, if any, that will be
                    interested in each and every bit of data.
Is it atomic?       Definitely not. This monster functionality is bound to be logically composed of dozens
                    of smaller parts.
How to make it IRA? * Split it into smaller pieces. Think what describes a customer - they have their addresses,
                      phones, favourite products, contact methods they prefer and so on - each of these
                      should be turned into an independent service. 
                    * Use ESB to create composite services out of the atomic ones

Variable            Notes
=================== =============================================================================================
Environment         A mobile telco
Functionality       Refilling a card in a billing system
Is it interesting?  Extremely so. Everyone wants to use it, through text messages, IVR, IM, portals, gift cards
                    etc.
Is it reusable?     Very reusable, it can take part in all sort of higher-level processes 
Is it atomic?       Yes, from the calling application's point of view, it can either refill a card or not. That
                    a billing system will implement this functionality as a series of steps is irrelevant.
                    From a business perspective it's an atomic, undividable service offered by a billing system.
How to make it IRA? It already is IRA.
=================== =============================================================================================

If you've done any programming in the last 30 years it is now very clear that
exposing a service is precisely like exposing an API in one part of code to another.
The only difference is that you're not dealing with submodules of a single system,
you're operating on a level of an entire environment of disparate systems.

---------------------------------------------
Making services available on an ESB in an SOA
---------------------------------------------

Now that you know that systems don't exchange information directly and 
you understand what a service is, you can start making use of an ESB.

.. image:: /gfx/intro/esb-ok.png
   :alt:
   
It now becomes the job of ESB to expose and invoke services of the integrated
systems. That way, in most cases, only one access method, one interface, needs 
to be defined between each system and the ESB.

So, like in the diagram above, you have 8 systems, there will be 16 interfaces
(one in each direction) to create, maintain, manage and take care of.

Without an ESB you'd have 56 interfaces to think of and deal with (assuming each
systems talk with each of other ones).

40 interfaces less means less time wasted and more money saved. That's one of
the reasons why your Fridays will be less strained.

This fact alone should make you strongly consider introducing an ESB.

If a system undergoes a rewrite, change of ownership, gets split between departments
or vendors, it will a duty of ESB folk to conform with the change. None of the
other systems will even notice it because their interface with ESB will be left
intact.

When you start breathe IRA services on a daily basis you can begin to think
of composite ones.

Remeber the 'give-me-everything-you-can-about-that-customer' kind of service above? 

It wasn't a good idea to create it but you will sometimes
have to deal with client applications that need aggregated and summarized information.
It will be ESB people that will be responsible for picking the best atomic services
to build a composite one for that particular client system requiring this particular
set of composite data.

With time the whole organization will begin to understand that it's no more about
database tables, files, batches, functions, routines or records. This will be 
about an architecture centered on interesting, reusable and atomic services
applications offer each another.

It takes time, patience and coordinated effort but it is doable.

-------------------------
But what watch out for...
-------------------------

The best way to ruin the whole concept of SOA is to roll out an ESB and expect
that matters will smooth out themselves. While still being a terrific idea, 
simply introducing an ESB won't achieve that much, unfortunately.

In the best case, sweeping something under the carpet, like in the diagram below,
will achieve nothing.

.. image:: /gfx/intro/esb-mess.png
   :alt:

Your IT people will loathe the system and the management will first tolerate an
ESB as a new kid on the block but later on it will become a laughing stock. 
"What, that new silver bullet? Hahaha".

Such consequences are inevitable if an ESB is not a part of a bigger plan of actually
moving things forward.
   
-------------------------------------------
An ESB is for banks and similar only, then?
-------------------------------------------

Not at all, no. It is a good choice for any situation requiring multiple data sources
and multiple access methods to co-operate in order to achieve an interesting result.

For instance, grabbing latest reading from thermal sensors and publishing it into
several channels, like e-mail alerts and an IPhone app does sound like a good fit
for an integration platform.

Periodically consulting whether all instances of a critical application are all up
and running a preconfigured script if they're not while sendind a text message
to admins also sounds just fine.

Everything that needs integration in a clear, well-defined environment is possibly
a good fit for an ESB service but as always, deciding whether something really is 
a dream fit will follow from one's experience. Naturally, the people behind Zato

--------------------------------------------------------
But I heard SOA was all about XML, SOAP and web services
--------------------------------------------------------

Yes, this is what certain people would like you to believe. 

If people or vendors you worked with did things such as BASE64-encoding a CSV file and sending
it over to you in a SAML2-secured SOAP message then it's quite understandable 
how you might develop such an impression.

XML, SOAP and web services have their uses but like anything, they can be misused.

SOA is about a clean and manageable architecture. That a particular service might
use SOAP or not is pretty much irrelevant. As an architectural approach, SOA
will still be valid even if no SOAP service will be used at all.

If an architect designs a beautiful building, they can't really do much
about the color of the paint people choose inside.

So no, SOA is not much about XML, SOAP and web services. These can be used too
but it's not the whole story of SOA. You are encouraged to point your colleagues
to this article to make them really understand what SOA is about.

----------------
And there's more
----------------

This chapter covers only the very basics but should still give you a strong
understanding how ESB and SOA should look like and what is needed to achieve
a success.

Other topics, not covered here, include, but are not limited to:

* How to get support from the management
* How to gather SOA architects and analytical teams
* Introducing a Canonical Data Model (CDM) in an organization
* Key Performance Indicators (KPI) - now that you have a common and unified
  method of providing services across systems, you should start to monitor
  and evaluate what is really provided to you
* Business Process Management (BPM) - how and when to choose a BPM platform
  to orchectrate the services
* What to do with systems that have no APIs? E.g. should an ESB
  access their databases directly (answer - it depends, there's no golden rule)

------------------------
So what is Zato exactly?
------------------------

`Zato <https://zato.io>`_ is an ESB and application server. It is open-source
software, with commercial and community support, written in `Python <http://python.org>`_,
a programming language famous for its ease of use and productivity. 

Using Python and Zato means you are more productive and need to spend less time
on nuisances.

Zato was written **by pragmatists for pragmatists**. It's not yet another system
quickly stitched together by a vendor in the wave of ESB/SOA hype. 

It was born out of practical experience in putting out fires caused by such systems.
In fact, Zato authors spent so much time on dealing with such horror environments
that they practically became immune to any fires.

This is the forge out of which Zato came into existence and that's why it
can offer productivity and ease of use unparalleled by other seemingly similar solutions.

See you `there <https://zato.io>`_!
